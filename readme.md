First User Story:

As a user,
So that I can see all the bookmarks,
I'd like the app to show a list of bookmarks

Steps to set up a database - 
1. Connect to psql
2. Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
3. Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
4. Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
